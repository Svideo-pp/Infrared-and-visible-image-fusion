# Infrared and visible image fusion
## About
This is a repository for our Year 2 Project, which counts to 56% grade of ELEC222. Our Academic Advisor is Professor Yaochun Shen.

## Background
Image fusion is an enhancement technique that aims to combine images obtained by different kinds of sensors to generate a robust or informative image that can facilitate subsequent processing or help in decision making.

The keys to an excellent fusion method are effective image information extraction and appropriate fusion principles, which allow useful information to be extracted from source images and integrated in the fused image without introducing any artifact in the process. Infrared or THz imaging sensors can capture infrared or terahertz radiation (blackbody radiation) emitted from objects. However, the acquired image usually has limited pixel number and spatial resolution thus it lacks enough background details of the scene. In contrast, visible images usually contain more detail and texture information because of its higher spatial resolution. 

Infrared and visible image fusion can produce a composite image that is more informative for human observation or computer vision tasks.
